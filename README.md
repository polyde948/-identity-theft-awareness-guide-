Identity Theft Awareness Guide

This repository contains a detailed awareness and technical guide addressing the rising global threat of identity theft. It explores how blockchain technology—specifically using Rootstock (RSK)—can be applied to secure digital identities and reduce fraud.

Overview

Identity theft is one of the fastest-growing cybercrimes in the world. With increased data breaches and phishing scams, protecting digital identities has never been more urgent. This project outlines a blockchain-based approach to identity verification and protection.

Tools Used

- Rootstock (RSK) Blockchain  
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)  
- MetaMask Wallet  
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)  
- WPS Office (for offline drafting)

Key Features

- Real-world examples of identity theft and consequences  
- Decentralized solution architecture using Rootstock  
- No-code or low-code steps to follow  
- Designed for non-technical users too  
- Portable and open-source  
- Focus on African and global context

How It Works

1. Explain the identity theft problem (data breaches, impersonation, phishing)  
2. Introduce the power of decentralized identity using blockchain 3. Show how to store and share ID securely using Rootstock + IPFS  
4. Guide includes visuals, awareness checklists, and protective practices  
5. Demo plan for no-code DID onboarding via wallet + JSON schema

Contribution Goals

- Educate non-tech users about digital identity threats  
- Propose blockchain-based prevention strategy  
- Showcase Rootstock’s real-world use  
- Inspire developers to build identity-focused dApps  

Files Included

- `README.md` (this file)  
- `guide.txt` (full guide with visuals + implementation steps)  
- `images/` (screenshots and examples)
